The solution involves forcing the evaluation of the finite portion of the infinite list before printing it using the `force` function (or similar technique that forces evaluation) . This ensures that the `print` function operates on a fully evaluated finite list.

```haskell
import Control.Monad
import Data.List (unfoldr)

force :: [a] -> [a]
force xs = xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..] 
  let finiteList = take 5 infiniteList -- This will evaluate the first 5 elements
  print $ force finiteList -- Now this works.
```
